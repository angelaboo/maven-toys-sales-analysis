# Maven Toys Store KPI Report

## Introduction
This repository showcases a Power BI report created for Maven, a toy store chain with multiple locations across Mexico. The report provides an interactive way for **monitoring key business metrics and high-level trends** based on transactional data from January 2022 to September 2023.

## Project Objectives
The primary objectives of this project were to:
1. **Monitor Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**: Track monthly performance metrics such as `Total Orders`, `Total Revenue`, and `Total Profit` using KPI card visuals.
2. **Analyze Sales by Product Category**: Visualize `Total Orders` by `Product Category` with the ability to drill down to individual `Product Names` for detailed insights.
3. **Track Revenue Trends Over Time**: Display `Total Revenue by Month` using a line chart, with drill-down capabilities to analyze trends by week and by day.
4. **Geographical Revenue Analysis**: Use a map visualization to show `Total Revenue by Store City`, with bubble sizes representing revenue and legends indicating `Store Locations`.
5. **Enhance Interactivity**: Provide slicers for `Store City`, `Store Location`, and `Store Name` to allow users to filter and explore data dynamically.

## Learning Objectives
Through this project, I aimed to:
- Gain hands-on experience with Power BI for data visualization and reporting.
- Develop skills in data modeling and DAX calculations.
- Learn how to create interactive and actionable dashboards for business stakeholders.
- Understand the end-to-end process of data analysis, from profiling to visualization.
